# ü¶Ä Rust Payment Processor

A payment processing system implemented in Rust, built for. It ingests transaction records from CSV, processes them through robust ledger logic, and outputs final client account states‚Äîall with minimal memory overhead and modular design.

---

## üìÅ Features

- Efficient CSV streaming, built for handling large datasets
- Implements transaction validation rules that are enforced even before we begin processing transaction.
- Support for all transaction types:
  - `deposit` ‚Äî Adds funds to available balance
  - `withdrawal` ‚Äî Deducts funds from available balance if sufficient
  - `dispute` ‚Äî Moves funds from available to held
  - `resolve` ‚Äî Releases held funds back to available
  - `chargeback` ‚Äî Removes held funds and freezes client account
- Maintains per-client accounts with:
  - `available` balance
  - `held` balance
  - `total` balance
  - `locked` status

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Prepare your CSV**
   - Format:
     ```csv
     type,client,tx,amount
     deposit,1,1,100.00
     withdrawal,1,2,50.00
     dispute,1,1,
     ```

2. **Run with CSV input**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- transactions.csv
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

This processor is designed for learning purposes, and while it handles all major transaction types, there are several known limitations:

- **Chargeback without prior dispute**  
  `chargeback` actions can be executed even if the associated transaction was never disputed, which breaks the intended flow of `dispute ‚Üí chargeback`.

- **Transaction ID duplication**  
  The system assumes the transaction ids are not duplicated and does not enforce uniqueness for `tx` IDs. This means multiple transactions may share the same ID, which could lead to ambiguity and logic conflicts.

- **Dispute can cause negative available balance**  
  Disputing a transaction subtracts its amount from the `available` balance‚Äîeven if that balance isn't sufficient‚Äîpotentially resulting in a negative value.

- **Multiple disputes per transaction**  
  Transactions can be disputed multiple times because there's no state-tracking to prevent redundant dispute actions on the same `tx`.

- **Limited error propagation**  
  The processor uses `String` messages or early `return`s for invalid transactions instead of leveraging Rust's rich `Result<T, E>` patterns and custom error enums, which would improve robustness and diagnostics.

- **Suboptimal lifetime and borrowing**  
  Some temporary allocations and borrowed values could benefit from more precise lifetime annotations or refactoring to reduce unnecessary cloning and improve memory footprint.

## üöß Suggestions for Improvement

To harden the processor and increase correctness:

- Track the lifecycle of each transaction (`Disputed`, `Resolved`, `ChargedBack`)
- Enforce one-time dispute actions per transaction
- Ensure `tx` uniqueness across the dataset
- Block disputes when available balance is insufficient
- Improve validation and error feedback via custom error types
- Improve memory usage with tighter control over variable mutability, borrowing and lifetimes
